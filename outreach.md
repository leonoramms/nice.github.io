## Our Commitment to Outreach

NICE is committed to communicating the excitement and importance of particle physics and
detector science to students, teachers, and the general public. We collaborate with CERN's
own outreach programmes and organise activities specifically tailored to Danish audiences.

## Programmes for Students

### Masterclasses in Particle Physics

The annual **International Particle Physics Masterclasses** programme, coordinated globally by
IPPOG (International Particle Physics Outreach Group), brings high-school students to university
labs for a day of hands-on particle physics data analysis.

NICE member institutions host Danish Masterclasses each spring. Students analyse real data from
ATLAS or CMS, then discuss results with students around the world via video conference.

**Next Masterclass:** Spring 2026 — locations TBA

### CERN Visits for Students

NICE can help facilitate visits to CERN for motivated Danish students, both at the high-school
and university level. CERN offers guided tours, detector visits, and summer student programmes.

- **CERN High School Student Internships (HST)** — two-week programmes for 16–19 year olds
- **CERN Summer Student Programme** — for bachelor and master students
- **CERN Technical Student Programme** — for engineering and computer science students

### University Courses & Thesis Projects

NICE member institutions offer courses in experimental particle physics, detector physics, and
related topics. Students interested in BSc, MSc, or PhD projects involving CERN experiments
should contact the relevant research groups.

See our [Members page](/members/) for contact information.

## For Teachers

### Teacher Programmes

NICE supports teacher engagement through:

- **CERN Teacher Programmes** — one-week residential programmes at CERN for secondary school
  teachers in physics, mathematics, and computer science.
- **Local teacher workshops** — organised by NICE member institutions on particle physics topics.
- **Classroom resources** — curated materials for teaching modern particle physics at secondary level.

## Public Engagement

### Open Days & Science Festivals

NICE member institutions participate in public open days, science festivals, and exhibitions
where the public can learn about particle physics, detector technology, and CERN.

- **Danmarks Naturvidenskabsfestival** — annual national science festival with NICE participation
- **University open days** — detector demos and particle physics exhibits
- **European Researchers' Night** — nationwide events each September
