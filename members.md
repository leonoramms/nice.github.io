## Organizational Structure

NICE is a national centre that operates as a distributed network of Danish research groups and
institutions. The centre is coordinated by a **Steering Committee** composed of representatives
from all member institutions, supported by a small coordination office.

  <h3>Steering Committee</h3>
  <p>The Steering Committee meets twice annually to set strategic priorities, review progress, and
  allocate coordination resources. Each member institution nominates one representative.</p>
