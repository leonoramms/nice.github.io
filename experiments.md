## Overview

NICE member institutions are active participants in several major experiments at CERN's
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere. Danish groups contribute to both physics analysis
and detector hardware, with particular strength in tracking detector and calorimeter instrumentation.

## LHC Experiments

### ATLAS

The **ATLAS** experiment is one of the two general-purpose detectors at the LHC, designed to
investigate the fundamental forces shaping the universe. Danish groups at the Niels Bohr Institute
(University of Copenhagen) and Aarhus University have long-standing ATLAS memberships.

**Danish ATLAS contributions include:**
- Inner Detector and ITk (HL-LHC upgrade) silicon strip tracker hardware
- Jet and missing-energy physics analysis
- Higgs boson properties measurements
- Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model

### CMS

The **CMS** (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment is the second general-purpose LHC detector.
Danish groups from the University of Southern Denmark contribute to CMS physics analysis.

**Danish CMS contributions include:**
- Top quark and electroweak physics
- Searches for new heavy resonances
- Phase-2 upgrade activities

### ALICE

The **ALICE** (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) detector is optimised for heavy-ion physics,
studying the quark-gluon plasma — the state of matter present microseconds after the Big Bang.
The Niels Bohr Institute has been an ALICE founding institution.

**Danish ALICE contributions include:**
- Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) — a novel silicon-tungsten sampling calorimeter
- Quarkonia and heavy-flavour physics analysis
- High-multiplicity proton collision studies

### LHCb

The **LHCb** experiment studies the differences between matter and antimatter using beauty
quarks. Danish institutions have associated membership and contribute to selected analyses.

## Fixed-Target & Other Experiments

### NA61/SHINE

The NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS studies strong interactions and provides reference
measurements for neutrino experiments. Danish groups participate in specific physics topics.
