## Funding Overview

NICE coordinates and facilitates access to multiple funding streams that support Danish
participation in CERN detector instrumentation research. Funding is sourced from national,
European, and international agencies.

---

## National Funding

### Independent Research Fund Denmark (DFF)
The [Independent Research Fund Denmark](https://dff.dk/en) provides project grants for curiosity-driven
research in fundamental science, including particle physics and detector instrumentation.
Danish CERN groups regularly apply to DFF for individual investigator grants and collaborative
projects.

### Novo Nordisk Foundation
The Novo Nordisk Foundation funds selected large-scale scientific infrastructure and research
projects in Denmark, occasionally including detector R&amp;D with broader technological relevance.

### Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF)
The DNRF supports Centres of Excellence across Denmark. Several NICE partner institutions
have benefited from DNRF funding for their experimental physics programmes.

---

## European Funding

### HORIZON Europe
Danish research groups actively participate in HORIZON Europe collaborative projects
related to detector R&amp;D. Key programmes include:

- **STRONG-2020** — European network for hadronic physics
- **AIDAinnova** — Detector R&amp;D for future accelerators
- **SiLab** — Silicon detector R&D collaboration
- **LHC experiments** — direct CMS, ATLAS, ALICE, LHCb funding channels

### COST Actions
Several European COST Actions cover areas directly relevant to NICE activities, including
detector simulation, data science for particle physics, and accelerator science.

## CERN & International Funding

### CERN Detector R&D Programmes
CERN itself allocates resources to collaborative detector R&D under the
[CERN Detector R&D Committee (DRDC)](https://cern.ch/drdc). NICE groups participate in
several CERN-recognised R&D collaborations.

### ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, LHCb Collaboration Funds
Each major LHC experiment has internal cost-sharing mechanisms and upgrade project funds
that Danish institutions contribute to and draw from as collaboration members.

## Applying for Funding

Researchers affiliated with NICE member institutions who are seeking funding for detector
instrumentation work are encouraged to contact the NICE coordination office for advice on:

- Relevant funding calls and deadlines
- Letter of support from NICE
- Coordination with other Danish groups to build consortium proposals
