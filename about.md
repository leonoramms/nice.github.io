## What is NICE?

The **National Instruments Center for CERN Experiments (NICE)** is a Danish national centre that
coordinates and supports Danish participation in detector instrumentation research and development
for experiments at CERN — the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

NICE serves as a focal point for bringing together expertise, resources, and funding from Danish
universities, research institutions, and industry partners. Its mission spans the full lifecycle
of detector technology: from fundamental R&D and prototyping, through production and integration,
to data analysis and scientific output.

## Mission & Objectives

- **Coordinate** Danish contributions to CERN detector instrumentation projects.
- **Support** researchers and engineers working on hardware and software for CERN experiments.
- **Facilitate** national and international funding for Danish particle physics instrumentation.
- **Foster** collaboration between academia and industry to develop novel detector technologies.
- **Promote** education and outreach in particle physics and detector science.

## History

Danish participation in CERN experiments has a long history stretching back to CERN's founding
years. Denmark was among the twelve founding nations of CERN in 1954. Over the decades, Danish
physicists and engineers have contributed to a range of major experiments, from the early bubble
chamber programmes to the modern LHC detector experiments.

NICE was established to provide a structured national framework for this participation, ensuring
that Danish expertise and resources are deployed effectively and that new generations of
researchers and engineers are trained in cutting-edge detector technologies.

## Research Areas

NICE activities span several key areas of detector instrumentation:

- **Silicon tracking detectors** — precision charged particle tracking for the LHC experiments.
- **Calorimetry** — energy measurement systems for electromagnetic and hadronic showers.
- **Gaseous detectors** — large-area muon and tracking detector systems.
- **Data acquisition & trigger** — real-time electronics and software for high-rate data selection.
- **Detector simulation** — computational modelling of detector response and performance.

## Governance

NICE is governed by a steering committee with representatives from all participating institutions.
The centre operates under a mandate aligned with Danish national science strategy and the
objectives of the Danish Council for Independent Research.
