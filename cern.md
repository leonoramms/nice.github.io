## What is CERN?

**CERN** (from the French *Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire*) is the world's
largest particle physics laboratory. Founded in 1954 and located on the Franco-Swiss border
near Geneva, CERN is home to the most complex scientific instruments ever built and is the
birthplace of the World Wide Web.

At CERN, physicists and engineers probe the fundamental structure of matter by accelerating
particles to near the speed of light and then colliding them. The resulting collisions recreate
conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang, revealing the basic building blocks of the
universe and the forces that govern them.

## The Large Hadron Collider

The **Large Hadron Collider (LHC)** is CERN's flagship accelerator — a 27-kilometre
superconducting ring buried up to 175 m underground. The LHC accelerates protons and heavy
ions to energies of up to 13.6 TeV (Run 3), producing around one billion proton–proton
collisions per second.

Four major detectors sit at collision points around the LHC ring:

| Detector | Type | Key Physics |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **ATLAS** | General-purpose | Higgs, top, BSM searches |
| **CMS** | General-purpose | Higgs, top, BSM searches |
| **ALICE** | Heavy-ion | Quark-gluon plasma |
| **LHCb** | B-physics | CP violation, rare decays |

## Key Discoveries

- **2012** — Discovery of the **Higgs boson** by the ATLAS and CMS experiments,
  completing the Standard Model of particle physics.
- **1983** — Discovery of the W and Z bosons at the SPS collider.
- **1973** — Discovery of neutral currents at the Gargamelle bubble chamber.
- **1954–present** — Numerous contributions to our understanding of the strong force,
  electroweak unification, and the structure of matter.

## Denmark & CERN

Denmark has been a CERN member state since its founding in 1954. Danish researchers
have contributed to virtually every major experiment at CERN, and Danish industry has
supplied precision components and services to CERN infrastructure.

Key Danish contributions include:

- **Niels Bohr Institute** — founding institution of the ALICE experiment; decades of
  ATLAS and theoretical contributions.
- **Technical University of Denmark** — silicon detector sensor and module development.
- **Aarhus University** — ATLAS physics analysis and detector hardware.
- **Danish industry** — precision mechanics, cryogenics components, electronics.

## The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)

The **High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)** is the next major upgrade of the LHC, scheduled to
begin operations around 2030. It will increase the collision rate by a factor of five,
accumulating ten times more data than the original LHC design. This unprecedented dataset
will allow physicists to study rare processes and search for subtle signs of new physics.

The HL-LHC requires entirely new inner detector systems for both ATLAS and CMS, and NICE
member groups are at the forefront of developing the silicon tracking detectors for these
upgrades.

## Future Projects

Beyond the LHC, CERN and the global particle physics community are planning the next generation
of accelerators, including:

- **FCC (Future Circular Collider)** — a proposed 100-km ring that could reach 100 TeV collision energies.
- **CLIC (Compact Linear Collider)** — a high-energy electron-positron collider.

NICE participates in detector R&D activities aimed at these future facilities.
