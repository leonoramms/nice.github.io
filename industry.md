## Technology Transfer at NICE

The detector technologies developed for CERN experiments are among the most advanced in the
world. Many of them find application far beyond particle physics, in fields ranging from medical
imaging and cancer therapy to aerospace, environmental monitoring, and industrial inspection.

NICE actively facilitates the transfer of detector knowledge and technologies between academia
and Danish industry, helping companies access cutting-edge expertise and helping researchers
reach new markets.

## Collaboration Models

NICE offers several models for industry collaboration:

### Research Collaboration Agreements
Formal agreements between a NICE member institution and a company, defining
joint R&D goals, IP ownership, and resource contributions.

### CERN Knowledge Transfer
NICE can facilitate connections with [CERN's Knowledge Transfer group](https://kt.cern),
which manages licensing of CERN technologies and supports spin-off creation.

### PhD &amp; Postdoc Secondments
Industry-funded PhD or postdoc positions where researchers spend part of their
time embedded in a company, applying particle physics expertise to industrial challenges.

### Technology Licences
Licensing of patents and know-how developed by NICE researchers to Danish and
international companies.
